            <p>In this simple website, I will list all the things I was able to do during my first two weeks at BCG. I will go over the amaing onboadring we had, and the technical skills I was able to practice last week.
                I made this website to showcase my HTML, CSS skills, I alos tried to apply the BCG color palette we learned during the powerpoint training.

                    <p>The first thing I have done during my onboarding week is learn the core BCG values. They really resonated with me and I intend to apply them in my daily life.</p>

                </div>
                
                <div class="flex-items">
                    <div>
                        <img src="images/integrity.png">
                        <h3>
                            Integrity
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Integrity is the first essential value in BCG, and I really like that. It means that I can expect transparency and honesty from everyone around me, and my other fellow BCGers can expect the same from me.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                        <h3>
                            Respect
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Everyone is treated with respect at BCG, and I could notice that from my first week. Everyone is nice and respectful.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                        <p>
                            This is by far my favorite core BCG value, BCG embraces diversity which means that I can learn from a plethora of people with different backgrounds and cultures.
